Blonde hair falls just above her shoulders
She's nineteen, but she looks a little older
With the prom queen smile, the cool vintage style
You're obsessed with her, and I don't blame you for it

But I'll never look like her
Not even if I tried
I'll never be cooler
Not even if I lied
Oh, she's whole where I am broken
She's great where I am good
And I'll never be like her
But you know I wish I could
